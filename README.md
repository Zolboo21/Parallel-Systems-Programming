## Contents

- **Matrix Multiplication Report:** For one of the assignments in the course, I conducted an in-depth analysis of matrix multiplication using CUDA programming. The detailed report outlining the methodology, code implementation, performance comparison, and insights gained from the experimentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Zolboo21/Parallel-Systems-Programming/blob/main/Matrix%20Multi%20Report.pdf).

## Usage

Each assignment folder contains the necessary code files and instructions for running the programs on the Jetson Nano or similar platforms.

## Dependencies

- CUDA Toolkit
